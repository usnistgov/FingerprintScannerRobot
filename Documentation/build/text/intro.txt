The fingerprint scanner robots are designed to automatically test
fingerprint scanners. There are two robots:

1. NAFSTR: Networked Automated Fingerprint Scanner Test Robot. A
   robot with four individually-actuated fingers that simulates simple
   fingerprinting.

2. NARFSTR: Networked Automated Rolled Fingerprint Scanner Test
   Robot. A robot that simulates rolling a finger across a fingerprint
   scanner.

Both robots are controlled by an Arduino Uno, and have an Arduino
Ethernet Shield. They accept commands sent over USB and over a
network.
