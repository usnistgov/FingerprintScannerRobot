Construction
============

To construct the robot, first print appropriate quantities of the parts in ``Final STL Files/NAFSTR``\ . Then, attach all the parts together and insert all the electronics. Here is a parts list of all the required parts that are not 3D printed:

.. csv-table:: Parts of NAFSTR
  :file: NAFSTRParts.csv
  :widths: 40,40,6,6,6
  :header-rows: 1

Electronics
===========

To assemble to electronics, look at the Fritzing file located at: ``Circuit/NAFSTRCircuit.fzz``\ .
