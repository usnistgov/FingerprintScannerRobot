Structure
---------

The robot has four adjustable legs, which support a linear actuator,
the electronics, and the fingerprint assembly. The following image
labels all the main parts:

Fingerprint Assembly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fingerprint consists of a fingerprint, held by two supports. A
roller rolls over the fingerprint, pressing it against the scanner.
The following image shows how it works:

[image]

The linear actuator pulls the roller towards the button. As the roller
moves, it compresses the fingerprint against the scanner, causing the
scanner the capture a rolled print. Once the moving assembly
(consisting of the roller and its support structure) hits the button,
the linear actuator stops, and then reverses.


Electronics Box
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The electronics box contains openings for all the connections and
buttons on the robot. The following picture shows all the main
features:

[image]

There are also four more openings on the back. These are to allow the
linear actuator and the button in the fingerprint assembly to connect
to the electronics in the box. The following image shows these
connections:

3D Printed Parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Almost all of the parts for the robot are 3D printed. The STL files
for the parts are located in "Final STL Files/NARFSTR". All of the 3D
printed parts were printed in PLA except for the fingerprints. (For
more information abou the fingerprints, see Fingerprints.) The PLA
parts were printed with a layer height of 0.2 mm using MakerBot's
"Standard" profile. We used a MakerBot Replicator 2 and a  5^th
Generation Replicator. The following table lists each part's name and
quantity.

Electronic Parts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following table lists all the electronic parts. Parts that are
marked with * are close to the parts I used, but may not be exact.
This is because the parts I used came from kits or other sources, and
I was unable to determine their exact information. For the male and
female banana plugs, 3 different colors are recommended: 1 red, 1
black, 2 blue.

Legs and Actuator Mount Assembly
--------------------------------


Legs
~~~~

There are two leg assemblies: one on the side of the actuator with the
motor, and one on the other side. Both are assembled the same way, but
they use different leg adapters. To assemble a leg assembly, first
screw a lock nut onto the threaded bolt in the center of the lower
adjustable foot. Repeat for the other leg. Then, put an upper
adjustable foot piece on top of each lower adjustable foot piece. Push
down until the lock nut clicks, locking the lower part to the upper
part. Then, insert a bolt head into the square hole on top of each
upper adjustable foot. Screw the square head into the bolt using one
of the black screws. Finally, connect each foot assembly to the lower
part of a leg adapter. Secure the connection by screwing golden screws
into the holes on the upper adjustable foot. Repeat this process with
the other leg adapter to make the other leg assembly.

Electronics Box Assembly
------------------------

**Note:** assemble the electronics before assembling the box.

Slide Arduino Uno (with Arduino Ethernet Shield) into the box. Screw
female banana plugs into holes of electronics housing. If using
colors, put a red jack and a black jack into the top row, and put two
blue jacks in the bottom row. Then, super glue the LED cap into the
LED hole.

[image]

Super glue the front tab onto the bottom of the electronics box.

[image]

Assemble the top lid by inserting the power switch and the trigger
switch into their holes. The power switch is the green rocker switch,
and the trigger switch is the red push button. Using epoxy, glue a 12
mm button into the DHCP reset button hole. The square base of the
button should be glued onto the plastic square on the bottom of the
top lid.

[image]

Assemble the power jack by inserting a female power pigtail into the
power jack holder. This may require some force. Screw power jack
holder into electronics box using a black screw.

[image]

Put all other electronics into the box in the empty area behind the
Arduino and put LED into LED cap. Ensure that everything is properly
connected. Then, put top on box and secure with two black screws. Put
back side on box and secure with one black screw. Finally, connect all
cables.


Electronics
===========


Design
------

The robot is controlled by an Arduino Uno microcontroller. On top of
the Arduino, there is an Arduino Ethernet Shield, which, through its
single Ethernet port, allows the robot to connect to a network. The
following components are connected to the Arduino through the header
pins on the shield:

1. RGB LED: serves as an indicator light.

2. Trigger switch: a red pushbutton, causes the robot to move its
   finger back and forth when pressed.

3. Limit switch: a 12 mm push button which detects when the
   fingerprint has finished rolling.

4. DHCP reset button: a 12 mm push button, causes the robot to
   request a DHCP lease.

5. Pololu VNH5019 motor driver chip: used to drive the linear
   actuator.

The robot has a single 2.1 mm DC barrel jack for power and requires 12
V DC at around 3A (estimated; based on peak motor current draw). The
12 V lines are attached directly to the motor control board, and the
Arduino is powered by the output of a 5V Universal Battery Elimination
Circuit (UBEC). The UBEC can produces a regulated 5 V output at a
current of up to 3A. This works far better than the Arduino's built-in
regulator, which, though it can handle 12 volts, gets very hot when
doing so and has trouble providing the necessary current for both the
Arduino and the Ethernet Shield. The robot also has a power switch,
which is connected to the 12 V input line.

Here is a schematic:

[image]

There is no Ethernet Shield in the schematic, but it would be placed
on top of the Arduino.


Assembly
--------

First, put the Arduino Ethernet Shield onto the Arduino. Then, on the
5 cm x 7 cm perfboard, assemble the circuit using the schematic above.
For the motor and limit switch, which are mounted outside of the box,
connect their leads to the female banana plugs, which will go into
holes on the side of the electronics box. On the ends of the leads for
the motor and button (which will be outside the box), attach the male
banana plugs. Use the two blue plugs for the button's leads, the red
one for the motor's red wire, and the black one for the motor's black
wire. For the LED and other buttons, make sure they are connected with
long wires so they can reach from the circuit board to their
designated location in the box. Also, do not directly connect any
components that will be mounted in the box directly to the circuit
board. You will not be able to put the components into their holes.
Instead, use the tab connectors to attach the component to the rest of
the circuit. Finally, on all the 12 V lines (which, because they are
connected to the motor, would have high currents), use the 20 gauge
wire.


Fingerprints
============

The fingerprints used on the robot are 3D printed. The first step in
making a fingerprint is to generate a PNG image of the fingerprint. To
do this, I used SFinGe (**S**ynthetic **Fin**gerprint **Ge**nerator)
from the Biometric System Laboratory at the University of Bologna .
With the program, I configured various parameters of the fingerprint,
and once the ridges were generated, clicked the "View original" button
after every step to remove all the distortion and scratches. Once the
fingerprint was generated, I saved it to a bmp file and then converted
it to a png.

To turn the PNG into a 3D-printable file, I wrote an OpenSCAD script,
located at "Fingerprints/NARFSTRRolledFingerprints/roll.scad". This
script can take any black and white PNG image and produce a STL file
that, when 3D printed, will fit perfectly into the robot. To use the
script, configure the variables at the top of the file:

   imageResolution = 19.7; //dots per mm
   imageX = 416; //px
   imageY = 560; //px
   file = "FGen1.png";
   fingerprintX = 30; //mm
   fingerprintY = 30; //mm
   fingerprintScale = 1.4;

Once these variables are configured, hit "Preview" in OpenSCAD to make
sure everything looks good, and then hit "Render". This may take about
an hour. Once the rendering is complete, export the file as an STL.

This script will generate a very complex 3D file which contains the
fingerprint, mounted on a spongy area, which is mounted on tabs that
connect to the robot. Here is a cross-sectional view of the finished
product:

[image]

The two tabs at either end allow the fingerprint to be secured to the
robot. The fingerprint is on top of the raised area in the middle. The
holes in the raised area allow the fingerprint to compress, which
results in a better scan. Here is a close up view of the holes:

[image]

To 3D print the STL file, use MakerBot Flexible Filament. Be sure to
set the printing profile to the custom profile located at
"Fingerprints/ NARFSTR Rolled Fingerprints/fingerprintprofile.txt".
The custom profile, which is based off of the MakerBot flexible
filament profile, uses 1 shell and an extruder temperature of 140 Â°C.
